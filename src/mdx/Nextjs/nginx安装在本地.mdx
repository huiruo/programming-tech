```
source ~/.bash_profile
brew install nginx
```

Docroot is: /opt/homebrew/var/www

启动：
brew services start nginx

Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/nginx/bin/nginx -g daemon\ off\

```
==> curl
curl is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have curl first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find curl you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/include"

zsh completions have been installed to:
  /opt/homebrew/opt/curl/share/zsh/site-functions
==> python@3.11
Python is installed as
  /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11

Unversioned and major-versioned symlinks `python`, `python3`, `python-config`, `python3-config`, `pip`, `pip3`, etc. pointing to
`python3.11`, `python3.11-config`, `pip3.11` etc., respectively, are installed into
  /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3.11 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages
```

## 修改配置：
